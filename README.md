# Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator project. The calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

To use the Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Requirements

The Calculator project has the following requirements:

- HTML5 compatible web browser.

## Files

The project repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the calculator interface.
- `calculator.css`: The CSS file that styles the calculator interface.
- `calculator.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the calculator logic.

## How It Works

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the calculator interface, including the number buttons, operator buttons, and the result display. The CSS file `calculator.css` provides the styling for the interface.

The calculator logic is implemented in the JavaScript file `calculator.js`. When a number or operator button is clicked, the corresponding value is appended to the result display. If an operator button is clicked consecutively, it is ignored. The `clear` button clears the result display, and the `equals` button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
